# Akatmks/build-svt-av1

This is a GitHub Action to build SVT-AV1 for Windows x86-64 & arm64, Linux x86-64, and macOS arm64 & x86-64.  
By utilising the best compiler and best procedure, including LTO and PGO, this building script creates highly optimised builds within 1% of the best possible build.  

SVT-AV1 variants and build repositories using this action or currently in the process of implementing this action:  
– [5fish/SVT-AV1](https://github.com/5fish/SVT-AV1)  
– [SVT-AV1-HDR](https://github.com/juliobbv-p/svt-av1-hdr)  
– [SVT-AV1-Tritium](https://github.com/Uranite/svt-av1-tritium)  

## Usage

Please check the GitHub Workflow in the various repositories linked above to see how this action is used.  

This action will install clang, nasm, rust, as well as ffmpeg, MSYS2, and other components all on its own.  
If you want to link the static lib built by this action into other projects, you can use the same clang this action uses to build it. Currently we're using LLVM project `clang` & `clang++` on Windows, and full LLVM project toolchain from homebrew on macOS. Check the code for more details.  

Make sure you check the Maintainence section at the end.  

### Reference  

```yml
- uses: Akatmks/build-svt-av1@v1
  with:
    # Path to SVT-AV1 repository.
    # Ideally the absolute path to the repository should not contain any spaces or any characters that will confuse POSIX shell.
    # This directory will be littered after use.
    # Default: "."
    path: "."

    # Whether to build static app and lib.
    # Default: "true"
    static: "true"

    # Whether to build shared app and lib.
    # Set static and shared both to "false" results in nothing being output.
    # Default: "false"
    shared: "false"

    # Currently we perform PGO using either a clip of SolLevante or a clip of FoodMarket2.
    # Use "SolLevante" if this build will more likely be used to encode 2D content such as anime or some genre of games.
    # Use "FoodMarket2" if this build will more likely be used to encode liveaction and 3D content.
    # You can also set this to "false" and put your own PGO clip in `PGO/PGO.y4m` in the SVT-AV1 repository.
    # Default: "SolLevante" [You should configure this properly]
    pgo-video: "SolLevante"

    # PGO and binary check parameters.
    # You should use a parameter that's typical for this encoder.
    # Do NOT set `--preset` or equivalent parameters such as `--speed` in SVT-AV1-Essential.
    # Default: "--crf 20 --tune 0" [You should configure this and not use default]
    pgo-parameters: "--crf 20 --tune 0"

    # We currently provide multiple builds for different generations of x86-64 systems.
    # Set this to true to only build `x86-64-v3+znver2` version.
    # Default: "false"
    base-arch-only: "false"

    # Build dovi and hdr10plus into the app.
    # Default: "true"
    dovi-hdr10plus: "true"

    # Build FFMS2 into the app.
    # Sorry We don't support it yet.
    ffms2: "false"

    # Additional cmake parameters for building.
    # As an example, you can add `-DUSE_WEBM_IO=ON` when building SVT-AV1-Essential.
    # Default: ""
    cmakeflags: ""

    # Additional CFLAGS (CXXFLAGS), LDFLAGS for profiling and final build.
    # If you need to use spaces in the parameters, omit the yml quotation marks and use `cflags-profiling: -DFOO="BAR BAZ"`
    # Default: ""
    cflags-profiling: ""
    ldflags-profiling: ""
    cflags-final: ""
    ldflags-final: ""
```

### Results  

The binaries will be available in the following directory within the SVT-AV1 repository.  
```
BuildAction/[ARCH]/[STATIC]/[FILENAME]
```
* `[ARCH]`:
  * On Windows x86-64 and Linux x86-64, `icelake-server+znver5`, `znver2`, or `x86-64-v3+znver2`. Both `icelake-server+znver5` and `znver2` version can be missing depending on the specific GitHub Action runner.  
  * On Windows arm64, `armv8.7-a+crypto+sm4+sha3+fp16+sve+sve2+oryon-1`.  
  * On macOS arm64, `armv8.5-a+simd+crypto+apple-m3`.  
  * On macOS x86-64, `skylake`.  
* `[STATIC]`: `static` or `shared`.  
* `[FILENAME]`:
  * For the app, it would be `SvtAv1EncApp.exe` on Windows, and `SvtAv1EncApp` on Unix.  
  * For the lib, it would the respective native filename for the system. You can directly `-L` to the directory as well.  

You can also search for `[build-svt-av1] Result` in the logs. There will be a list showing all the resulting binaries below the line `[build-svt-av1] Result` for each `[ARCH]` and `[STATIC]`.  

### Note

This is not a requirement, but when you're using this action to build anything, we kindly ask you to include this message when distributing your builds.  
```
Thanks to studies and contributions from afed, Emre, Ironclad, Itachi Uchiha, Khaoklong, Miss Ashenlight, Soda, SwareJonge, Trix, Yiss, and other people in the community for discovering the method to build the fastest binary.
```
You may rephrase or translate the sentence if needed.  
You can also add additional names, including your own, to the list. The list is currently sorted in alphabetical order.  

### Maintainence

A new main version (such as `Akatmks/build-svt-av1@v1` → `Akatmks/build-svt-av1@v2`) will be released when:  
* We change the `-march` and `-mtune` in any of the builds, either due to new clang versions having different preference, or due to [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories) upgrading to a different hardware.  
  In this case the output binary path explained in the [Results](#results) section will be changed. Please follow the list of items below to update.  
* We change the compiler used in any of the builds, such as changing from `clang` & `clang++` to `clang-cl`, or changing from LLVM project clang to Intel oneAPI DPC++ Compiler.  
  This doesn't affect people using the app, but for people using the static lib, make sure things are still working.

Here is a complete list of items to update when upgrading `Akatmks/build-svt-av1`: (currently empty because we're on `v1`)
